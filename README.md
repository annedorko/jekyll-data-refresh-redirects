# jekyll-data-refresh-redirects
Easily manage many refresh redirects for your Jekyll site. Great if .htaccess isn't an option for you.

## Usage

Plugin requires these additional files to work properly: 

- \_data/redirection.yml
- \_layouts/redirect.html

Example files provided. The HTML template can be used as is. The YAML file will need to be updated to include your specific links.

After installing all of the appropriate files to their folders you should be set! This took me longer than I expected to get working so I figured Iâ€™d share what I learned in this repository. Code provided as-is. Feel free to share any improvements you make.
